FPS Zombie Wave Killer is a first-person shooter survival game built in Unity, where the player must fight off increasingly difficult waves of zombies. You must stay alive as long as possible by choosing carefully your weapons.


🎮 Gameplay



Survive waves of zombies(for now 12) that grow stronger over time.



Use a variety of weapons: pistols, shotguns, SMGs, and assault rifles.



Manage health and positioning to survive longer.



Each wave becomes more intense with faster and tougher enemies.



⚔️ Weapons \& Combat



Fully implemented shooting mechanics with aiming and reloading.



Dynamic crosshair system depending on the equipped weapon.



Ammo tracking UI that shows current and total magazine count.



❤️ Player Health System



Health bar with color gradient UI.



Health regeneration or health pickups can be added easily.



Game over screen with stats (waves survived, etc.).



📊 Features



Unity Input System integration - Modern and flexible input handling using Unity's Input System package.

Sound Design - Implementation of weapon sounds, zombie growls, UI sounds, and ambient effects to enhance game immersion.



Modular UI System - Dynamic HUD including weapon display, ammo type, health bar, crosshair, wave counter, and game over screen.



NavMesh AI - Enemy zombie movement is powered by Unity’s NavMesh system for efficient pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.
